        <p>Duration: January'22 - June'22</p>
        <p> As a Data Scientist at Viacom 18 Media, I played a crucial role in bridging the gap between data analytics and corporate strategy, contributing to projects that shaped decision-making processes and marketing strategies. I did two major projects during my intenship period.
        </p>
        <h4><strong> Project 1: TV Channel Ad Break Scheduling and Optimization</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Task in hand: </u> Leveraged Enhanced Machine Learning (ML) models to accurately predict retention, viewership, and market share variables, which were instrumental in the scheduling and optimization of advertisement blocks across six different channels.
            </li>
            <li><u>Use of ML Models: </u>Employed a variety of advanced machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to make strategic scheduling decisions.
            </li>
            <li><u>Feature Selection: </u>Incorporated over 40 diverse features to enhance the precision and accuracy of ad break scheduling. The features included were based on show timings, slot length, duration, genre of show, TRP of a show etc. 
            </li>
            <li>
                A key achievement was the innovative use of non-advertisement time slots, strategically utilized to maximize market share, thus providing a significant competitive advantage.
            </li>
            <li>The project yielded remarkable results, consistently achieving prediction accuracy within the impressive range of 76% to 85%.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Project 2: Advertisement Demand Prediction</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Accuracy of Model: </u>Successfully enhanced prediction accuracy through the implementation of an advanced algorithm, Light GBM, achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 93.3%.</li>
            <li><u>Baseline Model: </u>Notably outperformed the baseline accuracy of 74.4%, which was obtained using Random Forest Regression.
            </li>
            <li><u>Hyperparameter tuning: </u>Employed advanced techniques such as Random Search and Grid Search to fine-tune hyperparameters, optimizing the predictive model.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Demonstrated expertise in data cleaning, a critical aspect of data preprocessing. Utilized the BARC Database for accessing and filtering crucial data, ensuring the integrity and quality of the datasets. Applied Machine Learning techniques for predictive analytics, harnessing the power of libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
        </p>
        <li><u>Technologies Used: </u>Python, R, Machine Learning, NumPy, Pandas,  BARC Database, Data Cleaning and filtering.</li>
